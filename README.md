AISpy is an experimental app concept built using Flutter, a cross-platform toolkit made by Google. The app uses TensorFlow Lite, a deep learning framework for on-device inference.

The app combines artificial intelligence and gamification to acquire user submitted source images to enhance the underlying machine learning object recognition dataset.

The app protoype uses a fairly limited model with just under a hundred recognisable classes of object; ranging from a computer mouse to a fridge, a person or even a toilet!

To help improve the number of recognisable objects, the app asks the user to share photographs of objects it could not guess during the game.
